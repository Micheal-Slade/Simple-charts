# Welcome to the ONS chart template repo

Here you'll find our chart templates and in the [wiki](https://github.com/ONSvisual/Simple-charts/wiki) instructions on how to use the templates.

## Getting started

Download the files. Each folder has a template in it, running off core libraries in the folder lib and images in images. Each visualisation is customisable using the options in the `config.json` file. It reads data from a `data.csv` file.
