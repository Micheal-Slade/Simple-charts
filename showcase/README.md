A directory to generate a combinatory view list. 

## Structure 
- makepage.py - the main file generation script 
- index.html - generated html page
- allplots.json - parsed json data from the readme incase that is useful. 

## Contributing
When adding new plots, and updating the main README, the python script here needs to be also rerun to update the showcase page. 

This was made to be dependancy free, so a core conda installation should already contain all the tools necessary to run it.
